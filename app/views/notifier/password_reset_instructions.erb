Lost your password?

This e-mail is sent to you because someone (hopefully yourself) requested your password to be reset at resourcetracking.heroku.com

If you did not request this, you may safely disregard this message - your password has not been changed yet, and no harm has come from it!

To change your password, follow this link:
<%= @password_reset_url%>

This will present you with a form at which you can change your password.

<%= render 'signature' %>
