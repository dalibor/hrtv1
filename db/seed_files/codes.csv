 M&E therefore includes expenses related to ascertaining the direction and ultimate achievement of measurement of programme progress, the
provision of feedback for accountability and quality, and implementation of targeted programmatic evaluation, the implementation and upgrading of information management systems (e.g. other monitoring and health management information systems), the evaluation of prevention,

Surveillance implies ongoing and systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of data on a disease or health condition.
Collecting blood samples for the purpose of surveillance is called serosurveillance. Built upon a country's existing data collection system, second-generation HIV surveillance systems are designed to be adapted and modifed to meet the specifc needs of differing epidemics. For example, HIV surveillance in a country with a predominantly heterosexual epidemic will differ radically from
surveillance in a country where HIV infection is mostly found among MSM or IDUs. Surveillance for drug resistance is to be recorded under the below category .

HIV drug resistance surveillance is aimed at the epidemiological monitoring of the prevalence and to determine the circulation of resistant viral strains among specifc HIV-positive populations. This provides the number or proportion of HIV positive people in a given population whose HIV is resistant to particular anti-HIV drugs.
The genotypic antiretroviral resistance test (GART) determines whether a particular strain of HIV has specifc genetic mutations associated with drug resistance. The test analyses a sample of the virus from an individual's blood to identify any genetic mutations associated with resistance
to specifc drugs. The phenotypic assay is different from a genotypic assay; it uses an indirect method, and determines by a direct experiment whether a particular strain of HIV is resistant to anti-HIV drugs.",HIV,HC.7,4.06,,,
