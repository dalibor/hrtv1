,,,,Serological Surveillance,,,,Serological Surveillance,"This category includes expenditure on registry@ processing of information to be used to document the incidence@ and specifc prevalence of the epidemic in the general population as well as in specifc populations. Also included are sentinel studies@ mandatory reporting of cases@ and epidemiological analysis. Surveillance implies ongoing and systematic collection@ analysis@ and interpretation of data on a disease or health condition.
Collecting blood samples for the purpose of surveillance is called serosurveillance. Built upon a country's existing data collection system@ second-generation HIV surveillance systems are designed to be adapted and modifed to meet the specifc needs of differing epidemics. For example@ HIV surveillance in a country with a predominantly heterosexual epidemic will differ radically from
surveillance in a country where HIV infection is mostly found among MSM or IDUs. Surveillance for drug resistance is to be recorded under the below category . The surveillance programmes aim to improve the quality and diversity of information sources by developing and implementing standard and rigorous study protocols@ using appropriate methods and tools.",Nasa,Across all 3 objectives,,Planning and M&E,,4.05 Serological-surveillance (Serosurveillance),1200,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,HIV Drug-Resistance Surveillance,,,,HIV Drug-Resistance Surveillance,"HIV drug-resistance surveillance includes the setting up of sentinel sites@ laboratory operations@ materials and goods@ and the integration and support for the activities of a National HIV-Drug Resistance Committee. HIV drug resistance surveillance is aimed at the epidemiological monitoring of the prevalence and to determine the circulation of resistant viral strains among specifc HIV-positive populations. This provides the number or proportion of HIV positive people in a given population whose HIV is resistant to particular anti-HIV drugs.
The genotypic antiretroviral resistance test (GART) determines whether a particular strain of HIV has specifc genetic mutations associated with drug resistance. The test analyses a sample of the virus from an individual's blood to identify any genetic mutations associated with resistance
to specifc drugs. The phenotypic assay is different from a genotypic assay, it uses an indirect method@ and determines by a direct experiment whether a particular strain of HIV is resistant to anti-HIV drugs.",Nasa,Across all 3 objectives,,Planning and M&E,,4.06 HIV drug-resistance surveillance,1201,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,Drug Supply Systems,,,,Drug Supply Systems,"Drug supply systems  include the procurement processes@ logistics@ transportation@ and supply of antiretroviral and other essential drugs for the care of people living with HIV. These expenditures aim to increase the capacity of logistics and drug supply systems@ including staffng@ development of administrative systems@ and upgrading of transportation infrastructure.
These activities involve support systems for pharmaceuticals@ diagnostics@ medical equipment@ medical commodities@ and supplies to provide care and treatment of people living with HIV and related infections. This includes the design@ development@ and implementation of improved systems for forecasting@ procurement@ storage@ distribution@ and performance monitoring of HIV pharmaceuticals@ and of relevant commodities and supplies. This includes actual spending to improve ordering@ procurement@ shipment@ and delivery of the full range of HIV-related pharmaceuticals@ diagnostics@ and other medical commodities.
