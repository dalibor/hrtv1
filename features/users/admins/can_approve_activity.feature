Feature: Admin can approve a code breakdown for each activity
  In order to increase the quality of information reported
  As an admin
  I want to be able to approve activity splits via the admin data response review screen

  Background:
   Given an organization exists with name: "UNAIDS"
    And a data_request exists with title: "Req1", organization: the organization
    And an organization exists with name: "WHO"
    And a data_response exists with data_request: the data_request, organization: the organization
    And a project exists with name: "TB Treatment Project", data_response: the data_response
    And an activity exists with name: "TB Drugs procurement", data_response: the data_response, project: the project
    And a mtef_code exists with short_display: "Mtef code"
    And a coding_budget exists with code: the mtef_code, activity: the activity, amount: "1000"
    And an admin exists with email: "pink.panther@hrt.com"
    And I am signed in as "pink.panther@hrt.com"


    @javascript
    Scenario: See a budget coding breakdown
     When I go to the admin review data response page for organization "WHO", request "Req1"
      And wait a few moments
     Then I should see "Mtef code"
      And I should see "1,000"


    # NB: this scenario will only work for 1 activity, 1 classification
    @javascript
    Scenario: Approve a budget coding breakdown
     When I go to the admin review data response page for organization "WHO", request "Req1"
      And I click element "#project_details"
      And I click element ".project .descr"
      And I click element "#projects .activity_details"
      And I click element "#projects .activity .descr"
     Then I should see "Approved?"

     When I check "approve_activity"
      And wait a few moments
      And I go to the admin review data response page for organization "WHO", request "Req1"
     Then the "approve_activity" checkbox should be checked
