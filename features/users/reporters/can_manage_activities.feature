  Background:
    Given an organization exists with name: "organization1"
    And a data_request exists with title: "data_request1"
    And an organization "my_organization" exists with name: "organization2"
    And a data_response exists with data_request: the data_request, organization: organization "my_organization"
    And a reporter exists with username: "reporter", organization: organization "my_organization"
    And a project exists with name: "project1", budget: "20000", data_response: the data_response
    And a location exists with short_display: "Location1"
    And the location is one of the project's locations
    And a location exists with short_display: "Location2"
    And the location is one of the project's locations
    And I am signed in as "reporter"

    And I follow "Projects"

    @javascript
  Scenario: Reporter can add outputs
    When I follow "Add" within ".sub-head:nth-child(2)"
