Feature: Reporter can see comments
  In order to help reporters see missed areas
  As a reporter
  I want to be able to see comments that reviewers have made

  Background:
    Given a basic org + reporter profile, with data response, signed in
      And a comment exists with title: "title1", comment: "comment1", commentable: the project



    Scenario: See latest comments on dashboard
      When I follow "Dashboard"
      Then I should see "Recent Comments"
        And I should see "title1"
        And I should see "on Project: "
        And I should see "TB Treatment Project"


    Scenario: Access comments page from dashboard and edit them
      Given I follow "Dashboard"
      When I follow "all comments"
      Then I should be on the comments page
        And I should see "TB Treatment Project"
        And I should see "comment1"

      When I follow "Edit"
        And I fill in "Title" with "comment1 edited"
        And I press "Update"
      Then I should see "comment1 edited"


    Scenario: Reporter can see only comments from his organization
      Given a organization exists with name: "USAID"
        And a data_response exists with data_request: the data_request, organization: the organization
        And a reporter exists with username: "other_user", organization: the organization, current_response: the data_response
        And a project exists with name: "Other Project", data_response: the data_response
        And a comment exists with title: "title2", comment: "comment2", commentable: the project, user: the reporter
      When I go to the comments page
      Then I should see "comment1"
        And I should not see "comment2"
