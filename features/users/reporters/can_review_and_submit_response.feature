Feature: Reporter can Review & Submit response
  In order to send data information
  As a reporter
  I want to be able to Review & Submit response


  Scenario: Reporter can Review & Submit response when it's ready
    Given an organization exists
      And a data_request exists with organization: the organization
      And data_response should exist with data_request: the data_request, organization: the organization
      And a project exists with data_response: the data_response
      And a classified_activity exists with data_response: the data_response, project: the project
      And a reporter exists with email: "reporter@hrtapp.com", organization: the organization
      And I am signed in as "reporter@hrtapp.com"
    When I follow "Projects & Activities"
      And I follow "Review & Submit"
      And I follow "Submit"
    Then I should see "Successfully submitted. We will review your data and get back to you with any questions. Thank you."
      And I should see "This response has already been submitted."
      And I should not see "Submit" within ".submit"


  Scenario: Reporter cannot Submit response when it's not ready
    Given an organization exists
      And a data_request exists with organization: the organization
      And data_response should exist with data_request: the data_request, organization: the organization
      And a project exists with data_response: the data_response
      And a reporter exists with email: "reporter@hrtapp.com", organization: the organization
      And I am signed in as "reporter@hrtapp.com"
    When I follow "Projects & Activities"
      And I follow "Review & Submit"
    Then I should see "Submit Response"
    When I follow "Submit"
    Then I should see "Oops, we couldn't process your submission."
      And I should see "Activites are not yet classified."
